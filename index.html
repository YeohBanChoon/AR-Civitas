                    AR Civitas is an application that use augmented reality (AR) to help you navigate when walking. AR Civitas is focusing on the Lebuh Cannon (“Boy on Chair” mural) to Armenian Street Ghaut (“The Giant Cat” mural) at the heritage area of Penang which is also a tourist attraction. AR Civitas provide the user with the live feed from the user’s camera to overlay walking directions on top of the real world and help the user figure out which way to go. Arrows and directions are placed in the real world to guide your way, helping you identify exactly where to make those tricky turns or which way to start your journey.   Penang heritage area is mostly covered by the colourful mural that attract everyone that see it so we decided to add another function in AR Civitas that can scan the mural for a further detail with description. The user can gain extra knowledge from it and understand the message behind those art.
